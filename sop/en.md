## **Article 12 — Activity Management**

To ensure vPLAAF’s sustained operational capability as a VSOA (Virtual Special Operations Association) member, its audit compliance, and the training quality of its members, the following activity management provisions are established in accordance with the relevant requirements of the **VATSIM Special Operations Policy v4.0**.

------

### **1. Definition of Active Member**

A member shall be recognized as an **Active Pilot** of vPLAAF if meeting all of the following:

- **At least one online flight using a vPLAAF callsign within the past 90 days**, with the organization’s website included in the flight plan remarks.
- Completion of all required basic training items of the organization.
- Continued compliance with the VATSIM CoC/CoR and vPLAAF internal regulations.

Members who do not meet the first requirement automatically become **Inactive**.

------

### **2. Minimum Number of Active Members**

To satisfy VSOP compliance, vPLAAF shall maintain:

> **A minimum of 10 Active Pilots.**

If the number of active members falls below this standard, the organization will be considered at compliance risk and must immediately implement recruitment and activity-boosting measures.

------

### **3. Minimum Online Flight Requirement (Organizational Level)**

According to VSOP requirements:

> **vPLAAF must complete at least 10 online flights using vPLAAF callsigns within any rolling 60-day period.**

This is an organizational metric; it is not required that a specific member completes it, but must be collectively achieved by vPLAAF members.

If the requirement is not met:

- The organization will be regarded as failing to meet VSOA activity audit standards.
- During audit, the organization may be required to complete the 10 flights within a 60-day correction period, or risk losing qualification.

------

### **4. Individual Activity Requirements**

To ensure training quality and operational readiness, vPLAAF requires members to:

- Perform at least **one online flight every 90 days**.
- Participate in at least **one organizational event or internal training every 180 days**.

------

### **5. Handling of Inactive Members**

If a member has no online flights for more than 90 days:

1. Their status automatically changes from **Active** to **Inactive**.
2. Training privileges and mission eligibility are suspended.
3. If more than 6 months pass without reactivation, the Personnel Department may:
   - Remove the member from the active roster (while retaining historical records).
   - Require reactivation procedures and mandatory refresher training before reinstatement.

------

### **6. Mandatory Activity Audit Readiness**

To comply with audit requirements, the organization must ensure:

- All flight records are complete and verifiable.
- The list of all Active Pilots must be publicly available (displaying at least CID).

Any member refusing to comply with flight record submission or information updates may be temporarily barred from missions.

------

### **7. Annual Activity Obligation**

According to VSOP:

> **vPLAAF must host at least one public event on the VATSIM network each year.**

The event must:

- Be publicly announced (VATSIM, forums, social media).
- Produce an official post-event report.

Participation in the annual event counts as a valid activity contribution.

------

### **8. Activity Incentives and Awards**

To encourage member participation, vPLAAF establishes:

- Monthly/Quarterly Top 10 for flight hours or number of flights
- Activity metrics as reference for internal promotions

------

### **9. Exceptions for Special Circumstances**

Members unable to meet activity requirements due to:

- Military service, long-term travel, or personal matters
- Medical situations
- VATSIM account technical issues

may apply for exemption through the Personnel Department.
 Exemptions may last up to **180 days**.
